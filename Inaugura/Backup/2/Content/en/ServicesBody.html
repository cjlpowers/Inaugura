<p class="Heading">RealLeads Call Management</p>
<p class="Text">The RealLeads call management system was designed with both the vendor and seller in mind.&nbsp; All calls are processed at our central station therefore, liberating this task away from you the vendor.&nbsp; This system features a property description, open house information and a real-time follow me service with full featured voicemail options.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="Text">The settings can be edited via the web and telephone and changes are done instantly.&nbsp; Potential clients simply call a local number and enter your property number, they are then asked to choose simple options to receive information regarding your property or are simply transferred to your numbers of choice.&nbsp; When they are transferred you have the option to accept the call or simply send it to our fully featured voicemail system.</p>
<p class="Text">This system eliminates important missed calls and offers you the flexibility to be reached when and where you want.</p>
